Question 3
Dutch national flag.

Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue
pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:

swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j.
color(i): color of pebble in bucket i.
The performance requirements are as follows:
At most n calls to color().
At most n calls to swap().
Constant extra space.

red in the left
blue in the right
white in the mid

int red = 0;
int blue = arr.length - q;
int i = 0;
while ( i <= blue) {
    if (arr[i] == "r") {swap(i, red++);}
    else if (arr[i] == "b") {swap(i, blue--);}
    else i++;
}
